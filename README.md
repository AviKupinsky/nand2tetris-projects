Nand2Tetris Projects
This repository contains my implementations of various projects from the Nand2Tetris course. The projects involve building a computer from the ground up, starting with basic logic gates and progressing to a fully functioning computer system, including an assembler, virtual machine, and high-level language compiler.

Contents
Hardware Implementation: Designing logic gates and sequential circuits using HDL.
Assembler: Translating Hack assembly code into binary machine code.
Virtual Machine: Implementing a stack-based virtual machine for the Hack platform.
Compiler: Building a compiler for the Jack programming language.
Operating System: Developing basic OS-level functionalities in Jack.
Tools Used
Hardware Simulator for testing logic gate implementations.
Assembler & VM Emulator for executing low-level programs.
Jack Compiler & IDE for writing and testing high-level code
